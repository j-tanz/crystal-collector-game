# "Crystal" Math Game

## [LINK](https://j-tanz.github.io/crystal-collector-game/)

### This simple math game generates a random target score ranging between 19 - 120 , and four hidden "crystal" values ranging 1 - 12.  


#### When the player selects a crystal, the associated value is added to the players score.  Matching the target score will count as a win, exceding the target score constitutes a loss!
