# [Crystal Math Game](https://j-tanz.github.io/crystal-collector-game/)


### This simple math game generates a random target score ranging 19 - 120 , and four hidden "crystal" values each ranging from 1 to 12.  


#### When the player selects a crystal, the associated value is added to the player's total score.  Matching the target score exactly counts as a win, while exceding the target score constitutes a loss!
